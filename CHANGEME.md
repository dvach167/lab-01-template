# Welcome to Git!
This is a markdown file. It's just a text file, but it lets you do some fun formatting stuff, like **bold fonts**, ~~strikethrough~~, *italics*, and as many cat emojis as you'd like :heart_eyes_cat:.

If you're interested in learning more, you can read [GitHub's markdown guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). However, knowledge of markdown is **not** a course requirement - you can just treat it like a text file if formatting isn't your thing.
